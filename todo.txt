Notes on Reimplementation
=========================

1. Since ReassignChildren() is always called after Redistribute(), it doesn't make sense to have two separate routines. Redistribute() seems to do either a left
or right rotation. Could I create leftRotate() and rightRotate() routines like a 2 3 4 tree? Could I also add similar helper methods to the 2 3 4 code:
insertChild(), connectChild() and disconnectChild(). Can I use an array of child pointers in class Node23 rather than smallest-, middle, and largest-child.
Currently, the code has a weird implementation in that Node23, if a 2-node, saves the right child in children[2] and not children[1]. This seems confusing.

Of course, the 2 3 rotation logic may not be identical to the 2 3 4 code, as the 2 3 code also uses a 4 node in some cases. So any change would first require 
understanding again what the 2 3 insertion code actually does.

  
2. The code could also be changed to use

1. unique_ptr<Node23>
2. array<K, 2> for the keys
3. Possibly array<Node23*, 3> or array<unique_ptr<Mode23>, 3> for the children
